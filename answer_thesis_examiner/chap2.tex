I would like to thank Examiner 2 for examining the thesis carefully. I have listed the comments below, and responded to each one. I have also rectified all of the items in the errata.

\replyToComment
    {Sec 1.1 and 1.2 should be reviewed again ... with proper citations on the background studies.}
    {This has been done: both sections have been reviewed with several new citations added}

\replyToComment
    {Paragraph 1 of Sec 1.3.3 should be removed or rewritten}
    {The paragraph were removed?}
%**IVM: why the question mark??
\replyToComment
    {The achievement of objectives should (also) be stated in the conclusion chapter. }
    {These have now been added into the conclusion chapter (with proper justfications based on experimental results and findings).}

\replyToComment
    {Replace the word ``theory'' with ``model'' throughout the thesis}
    {This has been done.}
    
\replyToComment
    {The proposed model is derived based on the existing statistical models for SAR and extended to POLSAR}
    {The main approach, as described in the thesis, differs in a subtle but important way.
The proposed model is derived based on generic mathematical results for multi-dimensional random-walk \cite{Goodman_JOptSocAm_76, Goodman_Springer_1975}.
That is: the proposed models by nature are applicable to multi-dimensional data and thus to POLSAR data.
To show that the proposed (multidimensional) models are also applicable to SAR data, the dimension parameters in these models are collapsed into 1. The thesis subsequently shows that they match perfectly with existing SAR models.

    {The proposed log-transform model will introduce an inevitable bias error, which may not be able to measure by MSE.}
    {
      It is true. In fact, the thesis does say that log-transformation will introduce bias. 
      It also shows that MSE evaluation does inherently include a bias evaluation.
      In fact, the thesis argues that MSE evaluation has two components: 1. bias evaluation and 2. variance evaluation, which, for evaluating the performance of SAR speckle filters translates into two criteria: 1. radiometric preservation and 2. noise suppression respectively.
}

\replyToComment
    {A more comprehensive review of the relevant SAR/POLSAR speckle filters should be included.}
    {The most recent review \cite{Argenti_GRSM_2013} has been included together with several other publications \cite{Lee_RSReviews_1994, Cetin_ProcSPIE_2000, White_ProcSPIE_1994, Sattar_TIP_1997, Wang_TIP_2004, Nielsen_2012_ICASSP}, all discussed within the thesis.}

\replyToComment
    {Wherever possible, samples of SAR/POLSAR images with these three types of features (i.e. homogeneous, textured and strong scatterer) should be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed models.}
    {In the section on evaluating speckle filters, various different patterns have been studied. Also the MSE evaluation which includes bias and variance evaluation are shown to be able to evaluate the effectiveness of different speckle filters in terms of radiometric preservation and speckle noise reduction respectively.}
%**IVM: Hai - do you think that this answers the examiners question? Maybe he is looking for visual examples?
    
\replyToComment
    {The work done has great potential to be published in high impact factor journals such as JSTAR, IJRS and PIER}
    {I appreciate the Examiner's vote of confidence. Portions of the work in this thesis have been written up as academic papers and submitted for peer-review.}

    {Define terms heteroskedastic and homoskedastic in the context of SAR imagery.}
    {Heteroskedastic and homoskedastic are terms defined in a statistical context to respectively denote the fact that different sub-populations of given samples can have different or similar variabilities. In the context of SAR (and POLSAR) imagery they denote the fact that different areas in a given image can have different or similar sample variance.}

    {Add references to the following statement: ``for example speckle filtering, target detection, image segmentation and other cluster, classification techniques''}
    {References added \cite{Lopez-Martinez_2003_TGRS_2232, Alberga_2008_IJRS_4129, Conradsen_2003_TGRS_4}}

\replyToComment
    {Add references to the following statement: ``most of these data processing techniques are traditionally designed for additive and homoskedastic data.''}
    {Reference added: \cite{Dutch_LNCS_2004}.}

\replyToComment
    {Add references to the following statement: ``Such use, however, is known to be not very robust for these so-called heavy detailed distributions.''}
    {Reference added: \cite{McElroy_Econometric_2002}}
    
\replyToComment
    {Add references to the following statement: ``it is known that such use should be avoided in preference to a ratio-based descrimination measure.''}
    {Reference added: \cite{Rignot_1993_TGRS_896}}

\replyToComment
    {Add references to the following statement: ``The Ordinary Least Square (OLS) is widely used as the best evaluation criteria, which is probably due to the Gauss Markov theorem.''}
    {Reference added \cite{Furno_1991_JStatCompSimul}}

\replyToComment
    {Add references to the following statement: ``violates the homoskedastic assumption of the theorem and thus many different ways to evaluate SAR speckle filters were proposed.''}
    {References added \cite{Gagnon_SPIEProc_1997, Argenti_GRSM_2013}}

    {It would be easier to read and refer if all the Equations are labelled accordingly.}
    {All equations in the thesis have been updated with labels. Originally I had used labels only for equations which were important or were referred to later.}

\textbf{Overall Comments \& Replies}

In general, I wish to express my appreciation towards Examiner No. 2 for his careful, detailed and concise review.
I also feel encouraged by the Examiner's suggestion to extract out portions of this thesis as scientific papers for peer review, which has also been taken up and acted upon.
