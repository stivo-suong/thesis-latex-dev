\section*{Reply to Examiner No. 1}

First, I would like to express my appreciation towards Examiner No. 1 for his \textbf{over-all positive comments}.
I also appreciate the fact that Examiner No 1 includes
  not only his comments in the examiner's report
  but also helpful suggestions inside the original thesis.
  
The examiner asked no direct question in his comments, so the following are my replies to his comments as listed in the returned thesis:

%**IVM: did you mention this in the thesis? If so, it might be good to mention.

    {Page 14: With reference to Equations 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 what are the range of $A_x$, $A$ and $I$}
    {The range of $A_x$ is from $(-\infty, \infty)$, and the range of both $A$ and $I$ is from $(0,\infty)$}

  {Page 14: Does the integration of pdf for $A_x,A,I$ sum to 1?}
  {With the defined range above, YES they are all sum to 1. This is easy to verify as they belong to the classes of Normal, Chi-Squared (2 degree-of-freedom) and Exponential Distribution respectively.}
