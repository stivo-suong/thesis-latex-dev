We prove theoretically that k-MLE is dually equivalent to a Bregman k-means for the case of mixtures of exponential families (e.g., Gaussian mixture models). k-MLE is used to initialize appropriately the expectation-maximization algorithm. We also show experimentally that k-MLE outperforms the EM technique with standard initialization by considering modeling color images using high-dimensional Gaussian mixture models.},

abstract={Objective methods for assessing perceptual image quality traditionally attempted to quantify the visibility of errors (differences) between a distorted image and a reference image using a variety of known properties of the human visual system. Under the assumption that human visual perception is highly adapted for extracting structural information from a scene, we introduce an alternative complementary framework for quality assessment based on the degradation of structural information. As a specific example of this concept, we develop a structural similarity index and demonstrate its promise through a set of intuitive examples, as well as comparison to both subjective ratings and state-of-the-art objective methods on a database of images compressed with JPEG and JPEG2000. A MATLAB implementation of the proposed algorithm is available online at http://www.cns.nyu.edu/∼lcv/ssim/.},

Standard simulated annealing approaches to image restoration attempt to categorize each image element as belonging to one of a small number of predefined image states or values. This is restrictive for tasks such as radar cross-section estimation and we present here an algorithm which is capable of producing a real-valued output. This is achieved by introducing an edge detection stage into the simulated annealing process. This original cross-section estimation is based on a flat region model. This is extended here to include linear sloping regions. Results using this new model are given and a qualitative comparison drawn with the original flat region model approach.},

abstract = { Abstract Speckle, appearing in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images as granular noise, is due to the interference of waves reflected from many elementary scatterers. Speckle in SAR images complicates the image interpretation problem by reducing the effectiveness of image segmentation and classification. To alleviate deleterious effects of speckle, various ways have been devised to suppress it. This paper surveys several better‐known speckle filtering algorithms. The concept of each filtering algorithm and the interrelationship between algorithms are discussed in detail. A set of performance criteria is established and comparisons are made for the effectiveness of these filters in speckle reduction and edge, line, and point target contrast preservation using a simulated SAR image as well as airborne and spaceborne SAR images. In addition, computational efficiency and implementation complexity are compared. This critical evaluation of speckle suppression filters is mostly new and is presented as a survey paper for the first time. It is believed that the information provided is sufficient for an intelligent selection of speckle filters for various applications. }

abstract={Speckle is a granular disturbance, usually modeled as a multiplicative noise, that affects synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, as well as all coherent images. Over the last three decades, several methods have been proposed for the reduction of speckle, or despeckling, in SAR images. Goal of this paper is making a comprehensive review of despeckling methods since their birth, over thirty years ago, highlighting trends and changing approaches over years. The concept of fully developed speckle is explained. Drawbacks of homomorphic filtering are pointed out. Assets of multiresolution despeckling, as opposite to spatial-domain despeckling, are highlighted. Also advantages of undecimated, or stationary, wavelet transforms over decimated ones are discussed. Bayesian estimators and probability density function (pdf) models in both spatial and multiresolution domains are reviewed. Scale-space varying pdf models, as opposite to scale varying models, are promoted. Promising methods following non-Bayesian approaches, like nonlocal (NL) filtering and total variation (TV) regularization, are reviewed and compared to spatial- and wavelet-domain Bayesian filters. Both established and new trends for assessment of despeckling are presented. A few experiments on simulated data and real COSMO-SkyMed SAR images highlight, on one side the costperformance tradeoff of the different methods, on the other side the effectiveness of solutions purposely designed for SAR heterogeneity and not fully developed speckle. Eventually, upcoming methods based on new concepts of signal processing, like compressive sensing, are foreseen as a new generation of despeckling, after spatial-domain and multiresolution-domain methods.},

  abstract = { Speckle filter performance depends strongly on the speckle and scene

	models, which have been used for the development of most of the well-known
	filters, are analyzed, and their implicit assumptions with regard
	to the stationarity-nonstationarity nature of speckle are discussed.
	This leads to the definition of two categories of speckle filters:
	the stationary and the nonstationary multiplicative speckle model
	filters. The various approximate models used for the multiplicative
	speckle noise model are assessed as functions of speckle and scene
	characteristics to derive the requirements on scene signal variations
	for the validity of both the stationary and nonstationary multiplicative
	speckle models. Speckle filtering is then studied in the context
	of estimation theory, so as to develop a procedure for speckle filtering.
	It is shown that speckle filtering can be effective only in locally
	stationary scenes. Regions in which the signals are not stationary
	have to be filtered separately using a priori scene templates for
	the best matching of nonstationary scene features. The use of multiresolution
	techniques is crucial for accurate estimation of filter parameters.
	Under the guidance of the speckle filtering procedure, structural-multiresolution
	versions of the Lee (1980) and Frost et al. (1982) filters are developed
	for optimum application of these filters in the context of nonstationary

abstract={Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are affected by speckle noise, originated by the SAR system's coherent nature. The problem of speckle noise in one-dimensional (1-D) data is already solved, as speckle has a multiplicative characteristic. SAR polarimetry represents an extension to multidimensional data by the use of polarization wave diversity. As a consequence of the existence of a correlation degree between the SAR images, the 1-D speckle noise model cannot be extended to multidimensional SAR data. This paper is devoted to present a completely new speckle noise model for the complex covariance matrix describing polarimetric SAR data in the distributed scatterers case. As is shown, this new model is able to identify which are the noise mechanisms in all the covariance matrix elements. The speckle noise model is validated by using real L-band polarimetric data acquired with the German E-SAR sensor.},

abstract = { The advent of fully polarimetric systems has led to an increased amount of information acquired by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors but also to an increased complexity of the data to be analysed and interpreted. In particular, the choice of several representations of the data, in terms of different parameters with peculiar characteristics and physical meaning, has been offered. With this work, we intend to address their systematic investigation with a twofold goal: (1) to provide a brief review of the polarimetric representations under consideration; and (2) to characterize and compare them with respect to their usefulness for classification purposes. The analysis procedure consists of the accuracy estimation of classification tests performed on different parameters derived from L‐band polarimetric SAR data. In order to ensure a common basis for their comparison, a neural network classifier, the Multi‐Layer Perceptron trained by the Back‐Propagation learning rule, was used which permits us to operate on the data without making any a priori assumption on their statistics. In this way, the considered polarimetric parameters, in general characterized by different statistical distributions, may undergo the same classification process and the results compared. Our results indicate that the overall classification performance varies depending on the polarimetric parameters used. However, these variations are relatively limited and do not permit us, at this stage, to define an ‘absolute’ best representation to identify the classes under investigation in an optimal way. }

Ratioing of the multidate radar intensities is shown to be better adapted to the statistical characteristics of SAR data than subtracting, and works best when the number of looks is large.
