abstract={Speckle is a granular disturbance, usually modeled as a multiplicative noise, that affects synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, as well as all coherent images. Over the last three decades, several methods have been proposed for the reduction of speckle, or despeckling, in SAR images. Goal of this paper is making a comprehensive review of despeckling methods since their birth, over thirty years ago, highlighting trends and changing approaches over years. The concept of fully developed speckle is explained. Drawbacks of homomorphic filtering are pointed out. Assets of multiresolution despeckling, as opposite to spatial-domain despeckling, are highlighted. Also advantages of undecimated, or stationary, wavelet transforms over decimated ones are discussed. Bayesian estimators and probability density function (pdf) models in both spatial and multiresolution domains are reviewed. Scale-space varying pdf models, as opposite to scale varying models, are promoted. Promising methods following non-Bayesian approaches, like nonlocal (NL) filtering and total variation (TV) regularization, are reviewed and compared to spatial- and wavelet-domain Bayesian filters. Both established and new trends for assessment of despeckling are presented. A few experiments on simulated data and real COSMO-SkyMed SAR images highlight, on one side the costperformance tradeoff of the different methods, on the other side the effectiveness of solutions purposely designed for SAR heterogeneity and not fully developed speckle. Eventually, upcoming methods based on new concepts of signal processing, like compressive sensing, are foreseen as a new generation of despeckling, after spatial-domain and multiresolution-domain methods.},

  abstract = { Speckle filter performance depends strongly on the speckle and scene
	models used as the basis for filter development. These models implicitly
	incorporate certain assumptions about speckle, scene, and observed
	signals. In this study, the multiplicative and the product speckle
	models, which have been used for the development of most of the well-known
	filters, are analyzed, and their implicit assumptions with regard
	to the stationarity-nonstationarity nature of speckle are discussed.
	This leads to the definition of two categories of speckle filters:
	the stationary and the nonstationary multiplicative speckle model
	filters. The various approximate models used for the multiplicative
	speckle noise model are assessed as functions of speckle and scene
	characteristics to derive the requirements on scene signal variations
	for the validity of both the stationary and nonstationary multiplicative
	speckle models. Speckle filtering is then studied in the context
	of estimation theory, so as to develop a procedure for speckle filtering.
	It is shown that speckle filtering can be effective only in locally
	stationary scenes. Regions in which the signals are not stationary
	have to be filtered separately using a priori scene templates for
	the best matching of nonstationary scene features. The use of multiresolution
	techniques is crucial for accurate estimation of filter parameters.
	Under the guidance of the speckle filtering procedure, structural-multiresolution
	versions of the Lee (1980) and Frost et al. (1982) filters are developed
	for optimum application of these filters in the context of nonstationary
	scene signals.},
