abstract={We present a fast and generic algorithm, k-MLE, for learning statistical mixture models using maximum likelihood estimators. We prove theoretically that k-MLE is dually equivalent to a Bregman k-means for the case of mixtures of exponential families (e.g., Gaussian mixture models). k-MLE is used to initialize appropriately the expectation-maximization algorithm. We also show experimentally that k-MLE outperforms the EM technique with standard initialization by considering modeling color images using high-dimensional Gaussian mixture models.},

abstract={Objective methods for assessing perceptual image quality traditionally attempted to quantify the visibility of errors (differences) between a distorted image and a reference image using a variety of known properties of the human visual system. Under the assumption that human visual perception is highly adapted for extracting structural information from a scene, we introduce an alternative complementary framework for quality assessment based on the degradation of structural information. As a specific example of this concept, we develop a structural similarity index and demonstrate its promise through a set of intuitive examples, as well as comparison to both subjective ratings and state-of-the-art objective methods on a database of images compressed with JPEG and JPEG2000. A MATLAB implementation of the proposed algorithm is available online at http://www.cns.nyu.edu/∼lcv/ssim/.},

abstract = {In this paper we first review an algorithm which performs radar cross- section estimation by using techniques based on simulated annealing. Standard simulated annealing approaches to image restoration attempt to categorize each image element as belonging to one of a small number of predefined image states or values. This is restrictive for tasks such as radar cross-section estimation and we present here an algorithm which is capable of producing a real-valued output. This is achieved by introducing an edge detection stage into the simulated annealing process. This original cross-section estimation is based on a flat region model. This is extended here to include linear sloping regions. Results using this new model are given and a qualitative comparison drawn with the original flat region model approach.},

abstract = {One of the biggest challenges for automatic target recognition (ATR) methods is the accurate and efficient extraction of features from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. We have recently developed a new SAR image formation technique which is recognition-oriented in the sense that it enhances features in the scene which we believe are important for recognition purposes. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of the images produced by this technique in terms of preserving and enhancing these features. The findings of our analysis indicate that the new SAR image formation method provides images with higher resolution of scatterers, and better separability of different regions as compared to conventional SAR images.},

abstract = { Abstract Speckle, appearing in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images as granular noise, is due to the interference of waves reflected from many elementary scatterers. Speckle in SAR images complicates the image interpretation problem by reducing the effectiveness of image segmentation and classification. To alleviate deleterious effects of speckle, various ways have been devised to suppress it. This paper surveys several better‐known speckle filtering algorithms. The concept of each filtering algorithm and the interrelationship between algorithms are discussed in detail. A set of performance criteria is established and comparisons are made for the effectiveness of these filters in speckle reduction and edge, line, and point target contrast preservation using a simulated SAR image as well as airborne and spaceborne SAR images. In addition, computational efficiency and implementation complexity are compared. This critical evaluation of speckle suppression filters is mostly new and is presented as a survey paper for the first time. It is believed that the information provided is sufficient for an intelligent selection of speckle filters for various applications. }

abstract={Speckle is a granular disturbance, usually modeled as a multiplicative noise, that affects synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, as well as all coherent images. Over the last three decades, several methods have been proposed for the reduction of speckle, or despeckling, in SAR images. Goal of this paper is making a comprehensive review of despeckling methods since their birth, over thirty years ago, highlighting trends and changing approaches over years. The concept of fully developed speckle is explained. Drawbacks of homomorphic filtering are pointed out. Assets of multiresolution despeckling, as opposite to spatial-domain despeckling, are highlighted. Also advantages of undecimated, or stationary, wavelet transforms over decimated ones are discussed. Bayesian estimators and probability density function (pdf) models in both spatial and multiresolution domains are reviewed. Scale-space varying pdf models, as opposite to scale varying models, are promoted. Promising methods following non-Bayesian approaches, like nonlocal (NL) filtering and total variation (TV) regularization, are reviewed and compared to spatial- and wavelet-domain Bayesian filters. Both established and new trends for assessment of despeckling are presented. A few experiments on simulated data and real COSMO-SkyMed SAR images highlight, on one side the costperformance tradeoff of the different methods, on the other side the effectiveness of solutions purposely designed for SAR heterogeneity and not fully developed speckle. Eventually, upcoming methods based on new concepts of signal processing, like compressive sensing, are foreseen as a new generation of despeckling, after spatial-domain and multiresolution-domain methods.},

  abstract = { Speckle filter performance depends strongly on the speckle and scene
	models used as the basis for filter development. These models implicitly
	incorporate certain assumptions about speckle, scene, and observed
	signals. In this study, the multiplicative and the product speckle
	models, which have been used for the development of most of the well-known
	filters, are analyzed, and their implicit assumptions with regard
	to the stationarity-nonstationarity nature of speckle are discussed.
	This leads to the definition of two categories of speckle filters:
	the stationary and the nonstationary multiplicative speckle model
	filters. The various approximate models used for the multiplicative
	speckle noise model are assessed as functions of speckle and scene
	characteristics to derive the requirements on scene signal variations
	for the validity of both the stationary and nonstationary multiplicative
	speckle models. Speckle filtering is then studied in the context
	of estimation theory, so as to develop a procedure for speckle filtering.
	It is shown that speckle filtering can be effective only in locally
	stationary scenes. Regions in which the signals are not stationary
	have to be filtered separately using a priori scene templates for
	the best matching of nonstationary scene features. The use of multiresolution
	techniques is crucial for accurate estimation of filter parameters.
	Under the guidance of the speckle filtering procedure, structural-multiresolution
	versions of the Lee (1980) and Frost et al. (1982) filters are developed
	for optimum application of these filters in the context of nonstationary
	scene signals.},
