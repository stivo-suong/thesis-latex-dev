   Abstract={Multi-channel systems appear in several fields of application in science. In the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) context, multi-channel systems may refer to different domains, as multi-polarization, multi-interferometric or multi-temporal data, or even a combination of them. Due to the inherent speckle phenomenon present in SAR images, the statistical description of the data is almost mandatory for its utilization. The complex images acquired over natural media present in general zero-mean circular Gaussian characteristics. In this case, second order statistics as the multi-channel covariance matrix fully describe the data. For practical situations however, the covariance matrix has to be estimated using a limited number of samples, and this sample covariance matrix follow the complex Wishart distribution. In this context, the eigendecomposition of the multi-channel covariance matrix has been shown in different areas of high relevance regarding the physical properties of the imaged scene. Specifically, the maximum eigenvalue of the covariance matrix has been frequently used in different applications as target or change detection, estimation of the dominant scattering mechanism in polarimetric data, moving target indication, etc. In this paper, the statistical behavior of the maximum eigenvalue derived from the eigendecomposition of the sample multi-channel covariance matrix in terms of multi-channel SAR images is simplified for SAR community. Validation is performed against simulated data and examples of estimation and detection problems using the analytical expressions are as well given.}

abstract={Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are affected by speckle noise, originated by the SAR system's coherent nature. The problem of speckle noise in one-dimensional (1-D) data is already solved, as speckle has a multiplicative characteristic. SAR polarimetry represents an extension to multidimensional data by the use of polarization wave diversity. As a consequence of the existence of a correlation degree between the SAR images, the 1-D speckle noise model cannot be extended to multidimensional SAR data. This paper is devoted to present a completely new speckle noise model for the complex covariance matrix describing polarimetric SAR data in the distributed scatterers case. As is shown, this new model is able to identify which are the noise mechanisms in all the covariance matrix elements. The speckle noise model is validated by using real L-band polarimetric data acquired with the German E-SAR sensor.},

abstract={Derives closed-form expressions for the probability density functions (PDF's) for copolar and cross-polar ratios and for the copolar phase difference for multilook polarimetric SAR data, in terms of elements of the covariance matrix for the backscattering process. The authors begin with the case in which scattering-matrix data are jointly Gaussian-distributed. The resulting copolar-phase PDF is formally identical to the phase PDF arising in the study of SAR interferometry, so the authors' results also apply in that setting. By direct simulation, they verify the closed-form PDF's. They show that estimation of signatures from averaged covariance matrices results in smaller biases and variances than averaging single-look signature estimates. They then generalize their derivation to certain cases in which backscattered intensities and amplitudes are K-distributed. They find in a range of circumstances that the PDF's of polarimetric signatures are unchanged from those derived in the Gaussian case. They verify this by direct simulation, and also examine a case that fails to satisfy an important assumption in their derivation. The forms of the signature distributions continue to describe data well in the latter case, but parameters in distributions fitted to (simulated) data differ from those used to generate the data. Finally, the authors examine samples of K-distributed polarimetric SAR data from Arctic sea ice and find that their theoretical distributions describe the data well with a plausible choice of parameters. This allows the authors to estimate the precision of polarimetric-signature estimates as a function of the number of SAR looks and other system parameters},

abstract = { The advent of fully polarimetric systems has led to an increased amount of information acquired by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors but also to an increased complexity of the data to be analysed and interpreted. In particular, the choice of several representations of the data, in terms of different parameters with peculiar characteristics and physical meaning, has been offered. With this work, we intend to address their systematic investigation with a twofold goal: (1) to provide a brief review of the polarimetric representations under consideration; and (2) to characterize and compare them with respect to their usefulness for classification purposes. The analysis procedure consists of the accuracy estimation of classification tests performed on different parameters derived from L‐band polarimetric SAR data. In order to ensure a common basis for their comparison, a neural network classifier, the Multi‐Layer Perceptron trained by the Back‐Propagation learning rule, was used which permits us to operate on the data without making any a priori assumption on their statistics. In this way, the considered polarimetric parameters, in general characterized by different statistical distributions, may undergo the same classification process and the results compared. Our results indicate that the overall classification performance varies depending on the polarimetric parameters used. However, these variations are relatively limited and do not permit us, at this stage, to define an ‘absolute’ best representation to identify the classes under investigation in an optimal way. }

abstract={An approach has been developed that involves the fit of a combination of three simple scattering mechanisms to polarimetric SAR observations. The mechanisms are canopy scatter from a cloud of randomly oriented dipoles, evenor double-bounce scatter from a pair of orthogonal surfaces with different dielectric constants and Bragg scatter from a moderately rough surface. This composite scattering model is used to describe the polarimetric backscatter from naturally occurring scatterers. The model is shown to describe the behavior of polarimetric backscatter from tropical rain forests quite well by applying it to data from NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPLs) airborne polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (AIRSAR) system. The model fit allows clear discrimination between flooded and nonflooded forest and between forested and deforested areas, for example. The model is also shown to be usable as a predictive tool to estimate the effects of forest inundation and disturbance on the fully polarimetric radar signature. An advantage of this model fit approach is that the scattering contributions from the three basic scattering mechanisms can be estimated for clusters of pixels in polarimetric SAR images. Furthermore, it is shown that the contributions of the three scattering mechanisms to the HH, HV, and VV backscatter can be calculated from the model fit. Finally, this model fit approach is justified as a simplification of more complicated scattering models, which require many inputs to solve the forward scattering problem},

abstract={When working with multilook fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, an appropriate way of representing the backscattered signal consists of the so-called covariance matrix. For each pixel, this is a 3 times;3 Hermitian positive definite matrix that follows a complex Wishart distribution. Based on this distribution, a test statistic for equality of two such matrices and an associated asymptotic probability for obtaining a smaller value of the test statistic are derived and applied successfully to change detection in polarimetric SAR data.

Ratioing of the multidate radar intensities is shown to be better adapted to the statistical characteristics of SAR data than subtracting, and works best when the number of looks is large. In a second set of techniques, changes are detected based on estimates of the temporal decorrelation of speckle. This method works best with one-look complex amplitude data, but can also be used with intensity data provided that the number of looks is small.

abstract={This paper addresses estimation of the equivalent number of looks (ENL), an important parameter in statistical modeling of multilook synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Two new ENL estimators are discovered by looking at certain moments of the multilook polarimetric covariance matrix, which is commonly used to represent multilook polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data, and assuming that the covariance matrix is complex Wishart distributed. First, a second-order trace moment provides a polarimetric extension of the ENL definition and also a matrix-variate version of the conventional ENL estimator. The second estimator is obtained from the log-determinant matrix moment and is also shown to be the maximum likelihood estimator under the Wishart model. It proves to have much lower variance than any other known ENL estimator, whether applied to single-polarization or PolSAR data. Moreover, this estimator is less affected by texture and thus provides more accurate results than other estimators should the assumption of Gaussian statistics for the complex scattering coefficients be violated. These are the first known estimators to use the full covariance matrix as input, rather than individual intensity channels, and therefore to utilize all the statistical information available. We finally demonstrate how an ENL estimate can be computed automatically from the empirical density of small sample estimates calculated over a whole scene. We show that this method is more robust than procedures where the estimate is calculated in a manually selected region of interest.},

abstract = { Abstract Multi-look polarimetric SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data can be represented either in Mueller matrix form or in complex covariance matrix form. The latter has a complex Wishart distribution. A maximum likelihood classifier to segment polarimetric SAR data according to terrain types has been developed based on the Wishart distribution. This algorithm can also be applied to multifrequency multi-look polarimetric SAR data, as well as 10 SAR data containing only intensity information. A procedure is then developed for unsupervised classification. The classification error is assessed by using Monte Carlo simulation of multilook polarimetric SAR data, owing to the lack of ground truth for each pixel. Comparisons of classification errors using the training sets and single-look data are also made. Applications of this algorithm are demonstrated with NASA/JPL P-, L- and C-band polarimetric SAR data. }

The derived Bhattacharyya distances for the two distributions, respectively, differ only in terms of a simple multiplier, i.e. the number of degrees of freedom (also known as number of looks in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data). The same aspect was observed for the divergence. Furthermore, the Bhattacharyya distance was found to be proportional to the Bartlett distance, while the divergence is proportional to the symmetrized normalized log-likelihood distance. The use of the Bhattacharyya distance and the divergence as separability measures of target classes was demonstrated by using NASA/JPL AIRSAR POLSAR data and was benchmarked against the Euclidean distance. From the results, both the Bhattacharyya distance and the divergence were found to perform consistently in measuring the separability of target classes.},

The backscattering power SPAN combined with H/alpha/A is used to obtain the initial cluster centers. We use the Wishart test statistic to perform an agglomerative hierarchical clustering to obtain the segmentation results with different numbers of clusters. The appropriate number of clusters is automatically estimated using the data log-likelihood (Lm), and the resulting images with the estimated number of clusters are the final segmentation results. The experiments show that the SPAN has additional information that is not contained in H/alpha/A, and this information could be useful for the initialization. The number of clusters seems to be a crucial point for the segmentation, which will affect the segmentation performance. It is also shown that the data log-likelihood has the potential ability to reveal the inner structure of fully polarimetric SAR data.},

We then derive the closed-form solution for one particular SMoG distribution, which is known as the multivariate K-distribution. Based on this new distribution for the sample covariance matrix, termed as the K -Wishart distribution, we propose a Bayesian classification scheme, which can be used in both supervised and unsupervised modes. To demonstrate the effect of including non-Gaussianity, we present a detailed comparison with the standard Wishart classifier using airborne EMISAR data.},

Abstract = {{Clustering is a technique that can be applied for unsupervised
classification of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (POLSAR) data,
an important analysis technique of radar polarimetry. Six matrix
distance measures have been investigated and compared through an
agglomerative clustering of RADARSAT-2 POLSAR data. The considered
matrix distance measures were used as similarity criteria for merging
clusters hierarchically into an appropriate number of classes. In this
study, the considered distances are Manhattan, Euclidean, Bartlett,
revised Wishart, Wishart test statistic, and Wishart Chernoff. Results
show that the Bartlett, revised Wishart, and Wishart Chernoff distances
all produce identical classification results. The Manhattan distance
retrieved classification results close to those obtained by the
Euclidean distance. The Bartlett, revised Wishart, and Wishart Chernoff
distances produced the most accurate classification results. The study
area is located in Hudson Bay offshore Churchill, Manitoba, Canada.}},

abstract={ Finding the edges between different regions in an image is one of the fundamental steps of image analysis, and several edge detectors suitable for the special statistics of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity images have previously been developed. In this paper, a new edge detector for polarimetric SAR images is presented using a newly developed test statistic in the complex Wishart distribution to test for equality of covariance matrices. The new edge detector can be applied to a wide range of SAR data from single-channel intensity data to multifrequency and/or multitemporal polarimetric SAR data. By simply changing the parameters characterizing the test statistic according to the applied SAR data, constant false-alarm rate detection is always obtained. An adaptive filtering scheme is presented, and the distributions of the detector are verified using simulated polarimetric SAR images. Using SAR data from the Danish airborne polarimetric SAR, EMISAR, it is demonstrated that superior edge detection results are obtained using polarimetric and/or multifrequency data compared to using only intensity data.},

	models used as the basis for filter development. These models implicitly
	incorporate certain assumptions about speckle, scene, and observed

	models, which have been used for the development of most of the well-known
	filters, are analyzed, and their implicit assumptions with regard
	to the stationarity-nonstationarity nature of speckle are discussed.
	This leads to the definition of two categories of speckle filters:
	the stationary and the nonstationary multiplicative speckle model
	filters. The various approximate models used for the multiplicative
	speckle noise model are assessed as functions of speckle and scene
	characteristics to derive the requirements on scene signal variations
	for the validity of both the stationary and nonstationary multiplicative
	speckle models. Speckle filtering is then studied in the context
	of estimation theory, so as to develop a procedure for speckle filtering.
	It is shown that speckle filtering can be effective only in locally
	stationary scenes. Regions in which the signals are not stationary
	have to be filtered separately using a priori scene templates for
	the best matching of nonstationary scene features. The use of multiresolution
	techniques is crucial for accurate estimation of filter parameters.
	Under the guidance of the speckle filtering procedure, structural-multiresolution
	versions of the Lee (1980) and Frost et al. (1982) filters are developed

  abstract = {The Lee sigma filter was developed in 1983 based on the simple concept
	of two-sigma probability, and it was reasonably effective in speckle
	filtering. However, deficiencies were discovered in producing biased
	estimation and in blurring and depressing strong reflected targets.
	The advancement of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology with
	high-resolution data of large dimensions demands better and efficient
	speckle filtering algorithms. In this paper, we extend and improve
	the Lee sigma filter by eliminating these deficiencies. The bias
	problem is solved by redefining the sigma range based on the speckle
	probability density functions. To mitigate the problems of blurring
	and depressing strong reflective scatterers, a target signature preservation
	technique is developed. In addition, we incorporate the minimum-mean-square-error
	estimator for adaptive speckle reduction. Simulated SAR data are

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new approach in polarimetric synthetic aperture
	radar (SAR) speckle filtering. The new approach emphasizes preserving
	polarimetric properties and statistical correlation between channels,
	not introducing crosstalk, and not degrading the image quality. In
	the last decade, speckle reduction of polarimetric SAR imagery has
	been studied using several different approaches. All of these approaches
	exploited the degree of statistical independence between linear polarization
	channels. The preservation of polarimetric properties and statistical
	characteristics such as correlation between channels were not carefully
	addressed. To avoid crosstalk, each element of the covariance matrix
	must be filtered independently. This rules out current methods of
	polarimetric SAR filtering. To preserve the polarimetric signature,
	each element of the covariance matrix should be filtered in a way
	similar to multilook processing by averaging the covariance matrix
	of neighboring pixels. However, this must be done without the deficiency
	of smearing the edges, which degrades image quality and corrupts
	polarimetric properties. The proposed polarimetric SAR filter uses
	edge-aligned nonsquare windows and applies the local statistics filter.
	The impact of using this polarimetric speckle filtering on terrain
	classification is quite dramatic in boosting classification performance.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce the homomorphic Gamma-WMAP (wavelet maximum
   a posteriori) filter, a wavelet-based statistical speckle filter
   equivalent to the well known Gamma-MAP filter. We perform a logarithmic
   transformation in order to make the speckle contribution additive and
   statistically independent of the radar cross section. Further, we
   propose to use the normal inverse Gaussian (NIG) distribution as a
   statistical model for the wavelet coefficients of both the reflectance
   image and the noise image. We show that the NIG distribution is an
   excellent statistical model for the wavelet coefficients of synthetic
   aperture radar images, and we present a method for estimating the
   parameters. We compare the homomorphic Gamma-WMAP filter with the
   Gamma-MAP filter and and the recently introduced Gamma-WMAP filter,
   which are both based on the same statistical assumptions. The
   homomorphic Gamma-WMAP filter is shown to have better performance with
   regard-to smoothing homogeneous regions. It may in some cases introduce
   a small bias, but in our studies it is always less than that introduced
   by the Gamma-MAP filter. Further, the speckle removed by the homomorphic
   Gamma-WMAP filter has statistics closer to the theoretical model than
   the speckle contribution removed with the other filters.}},

abstract={A class of fourth-order partial differential equations (PDEs) are proposed to optimize the trade-off between noise removal and edge preservation. The time evolution of these PDEs seeks to minimize a cost functional which is an increasing function of the absolute value of the Laplacian of the image intensity function. Since the Laplacian of an image at a pixel is zero if the image is planar in its neighborhood, these PDEs attempt to remove noise and preserve edges by approximating an observed image with a piecewise planar image. Piecewise planar images look more natural than step images which anisotropic diffusion (second order PDEs) uses to approximate an observed image. So the proposed PDEs are able to avoid the blocky effects widely seen in images processed by anisotropic diffusion, while achieving the degree of noise removal and edge preservation comparable to anisotropic diffusion. Although both approaches seem to be comparable in removing speckles in the observed images, speckles are more visible in images processed by the proposed PDEs, because piecewise planar images are less likely to mask speckles than step images and anisotropic diffusion tends to generate multiple false edges. Speckles can be easily removed by simple algorithms such as the one presented in this paper},
