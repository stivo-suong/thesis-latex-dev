abstract={This paper describes a novel approach to the reconstruction of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) fully polarimetric data from compact polarimetry (CP) $\pi$/4 mode. A method is developed which utilises a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based neural network, to perform reconstruction of scenes with various ground-cover types. In particular, the approach shows potential for the reconstruction of full polarimetry for built-up areas as a complement to existing techniques which are more suitable for natural land cover areas. Performance assessment is presented, using both L-band and C-band data, involving comparison with existing techniques using mean-squared and mean-squared-log measures.},

   Abstract={Multi-channel systems appear in several fields of application in science. In the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) context, multi-channel systems may refer to different domains, as multi-polarization, multi-interferometric or multi-temporal data, or even a combination of them. Due to the inherent speckle phenomenon present in SAR images, the statistical description of the data is almost mandatory for its utilization. The complex images acquired over natural media present in general zero-mean circular Gaussian characteristics. In this case, second order statistics as the multi-channel covariance matrix fully describe the data. For practical situations however, the covariance matrix has to be estimated using a limited number of samples, and this sample covariance matrix follow the complex Wishart distribution. In this context, the eigendecomposition of the multi-channel covariance matrix has been shown in different areas of high relevance regarding the physical properties of the imaged scene. Specifically, the maximum eigenvalue of the covariance matrix has been frequently used in different applications as target or change detection, estimation of the dominant scattering mechanism in polarimetric data, moving target indication, etc. In this paper, the statistical behavior of the maximum eigenvalue derived from the eigendecomposition of the sample multi-channel covariance matrix in terms of multi-channel SAR images is simplified for SAR community. Validation is performed against simulated data and examples of estimation and detection problems using the analytical expressions are as well given.}

abstract={Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are affected by speckle noise, originated by the SAR system's coherent nature. The problem of speckle noise in one-dimensional (1-D) data is already solved, as speckle has a multiplicative characteristic. SAR polarimetry represents an extension to multidimensional data by the use of polarization wave diversity. As a consequence of the existence of a correlation degree between the SAR images, the 1-D speckle noise model cannot be extended to multidimensional SAR data. This paper is devoted to present a completely new speckle noise model for the complex covariance matrix describing polarimetric SAR data in the distributed scatterers case. As is shown, this new model is able to identify which are the noise mechanisms in all the covariance matrix elements. The speckle noise model is validated by using real L-band polarimetric data acquired with the German E-SAR sensor.},

abstract={Derives closed-form expressions for the probability density functions (PDF's) for copolar and cross-polar ratios and for the copolar phase difference for multilook polarimetric SAR data, in terms of elements of the covariance matrix for the backscattering process. The authors begin with the case in which scattering-matrix data are jointly Gaussian-distributed. The resulting copolar-phase PDF is formally identical to the phase PDF arising in the study of SAR interferometry, so the authors' results also apply in that setting. By direct simulation, they verify the closed-form PDF's. They show that estimation of signatures from averaged covariance matrices results in smaller biases and variances than averaging single-look signature estimates. They then generalize their derivation to certain cases in which backscattered intensities and amplitudes are K-distributed. They find in a range of circumstances that the PDF's of polarimetric signatures are unchanged from those derived in the Gaussian case. They verify this by direct simulation, and also examine a case that fails to satisfy an important assumption in their derivation. The forms of the signature distributions continue to describe data well in the latter case, but parameters in distributions fitted to (simulated) data differ from those used to generate the data. Finally, the authors examine samples of K-distributed polarimetric SAR data from Arctic sea ice and find that their theoretical distributions describe the data well with a plausible choice of parameters. This allows the authors to estimate the precision of polarimetric-signature estimates as a function of the number of SAR looks and other system parameters},

abstract = { The advent of fully polarimetric systems has led to an increased amount of information acquired by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors but also to an increased complexity of the data to be analysed and interpreted. In particular, the choice of several representations of the data, in terms of different parameters with peculiar characteristics and physical meaning, has been offered. With this work, we intend to address their systematic investigation with a twofold goal: (1) to provide a brief review of the polarimetric representations under consideration; and (2) to characterize and compare them with respect to their usefulness for classification purposes. The analysis procedure consists of the accuracy estimation of classification tests performed on different parameters derived from L‐band polarimetric SAR data. In order to ensure a common basis for their comparison, a neural network classifier, the Multi‐Layer Perceptron trained by the Back‐Propagation learning rule, was used which permits us to operate on the data without making any a priori assumption on their statistics. In this way, the considered polarimetric parameters, in general characterized by different statistical distributions, may undergo the same classification process and the results compared. Our results indicate that the overall classification performance varies depending on the polarimetric parameters used. However, these variations are relatively limited and do not permit us, at this stage, to define an ‘absolute’ best representation to identify the classes under investigation in an optimal way. }

abstract={An approach has been developed that involves the fit of a combination of three simple scattering mechanisms to polarimetric SAR observations. The mechanisms are canopy scatter from a cloud of randomly oriented dipoles, evenor double-bounce scatter from a pair of orthogonal surfaces with different dielectric constants and Bragg scatter from a moderately rough surface. This composite scattering model is used to describe the polarimetric backscatter from naturally occurring scatterers. The model is shown to describe the behavior of polarimetric backscatter from tropical rain forests quite well by applying it to data from NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPLs) airborne polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (AIRSAR) system. The model fit allows clear discrimination between flooded and nonflooded forest and between forested and deforested areas, for example. The model is also shown to be usable as a predictive tool to estimate the effects of forest inundation and disturbance on the fully polarimetric radar signature. An advantage of this model fit approach is that the scattering contributions from the three basic scattering mechanisms can be estimated for clusters of pixels in polarimetric SAR images. Furthermore, it is shown that the contributions of the three scattering mechanisms to the HH, HV, and VV backscatter can be calculated from the model fit. Finally, this model fit approach is justified as a simplification of more complicated scattering models, which require many inputs to solve the forward scattering problem},

Ratioing of the multidate radar intensities is shown to be better adapted to the statistical characteristics of SAR data than subtracting, and works best when the number of looks is large. In a second set of techniques, changes are detected based on estimates of the temporal decorrelation of speckle. This method works best with one-look complex amplitude data, but can also be used with intensity data provided that the number of looks is small. The two techniques are compared using actual SAR data collected by ERS-1.

abstract={This paper addresses estimation of the equivalent number of looks (ENL), an important parameter in statistical modeling of multilook synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Two new ENL estimators are discovered by looking at certain moments of the multilook polarimetric covariance matrix, which is commonly used to represent multilook polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data, and assuming that the covariance matrix is complex Wishart distributed. First, a second-order trace moment provides a polarimetric extension of the ENL definition and also a matrix-variate version of the conventional ENL estimator. The second estimator is obtained from the log-determinant matrix moment and is also shown to be the maximum likelihood estimator under the Wishart model. It proves to have much lower variance than any other known ENL estimator, whether applied to single-polarization or PolSAR data. Moreover, this estimator is less affected by texture and thus provides more accurate results than other estimators should the assumption of Gaussian statistics for the complex scattering coefficients be violated. These are the first known estimators to use the full covariance matrix as input, rather than individual intensity channels, and therefore to utilize all the statistical information available. We finally demonstrate how an ENL estimate can be computed automatically from the empirical density of small sample estimates calculated over a whole scene. We show that this method is more robust than procedures where the estimate is calculated in a manually selected region of interest.},

abstract = { Abstract Multi-look polarimetric SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data can be represented either in Mueller matrix form or in complex covariance matrix form. The latter has a complex Wishart distribution. A maximum likelihood classifier to segment polarimetric SAR data according to terrain types has been developed based on the Wishart distribution. This algorithm can also be applied to multifrequency multi-look polarimetric SAR data, as well as 10 SAR data containing only intensity information. A procedure is then developed for unsupervised classification. The classification error is assessed by using Monte Carlo simulation of multilook polarimetric SAR data, owing to the lack of ground truth for each pixel. Comparisons of classification errors using the training sets and single-look data are also made. Applications of this algorithm are demonstrated with NASA/JPL P-, L- and C-band polarimetric SAR data. }

The derived Bhattacharyya distances for the two distributions, respectively, differ only in terms of a simple multiplier, i.e. the number of degrees of freedom (also known as number of looks in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data). The same aspect was observed for the divergence. Furthermore, the Bhattacharyya distance was found to be proportional to the Bartlett distance, while the divergence is proportional to the symmetrized normalized log-likelihood distance. The use of the Bhattacharyya distance and the divergence as separability measures of target classes was demonstrated by using NASA/JPL AIRSAR POLSAR data and was benchmarked against the Euclidean distance. From the results, both the Bhattacharyya distance and the divergence were found to perform consistently in measuring the separability of target classes.},

The backscattering power SPAN combined with H/alpha/A is used to obtain the initial cluster centers. We use the Wishart test statistic to perform an agglomerative hierarchical clustering to obtain the segmentation results with different numbers of clusters. The appropriate number of clusters is automatically estimated using the data log-likelihood (Lm), and the resulting images with the estimated number of clusters are the final segmentation results. The experiments show that the SPAN has additional information that is not contained in H/alpha/A, and this information could be useful for the initialization. The number of clusters seems to be a crucial point for the segmentation, which will affect the segmentation performance. It is also shown that the data log-likelihood has the potential ability to reveal the inner structure of fully polarimetric SAR data.},

We show that the distribution of the sample covariance matrix for the SMoG model is given as a generalization of the Wishart distribution and present this expression in integral form. We then derive the closed-form solution for one particular SMoG distribution, which is known as the multivariate K-distribution. Based on this new distribution for the sample covariance matrix, termed as the K -Wishart distribution, we propose a Bayesian classification scheme, which can be used in both supervised and unsupervised modes. To demonstrate the effect of including non-Gaussianity, we present a detailed comparison with the standard Wishart classifier using airborne EMISAR data.},

Abstract = {{Clustering is a technique that can be applied for unsupervised
classification of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (POLSAR) data,
an important analysis technique of radar polarimetry. Six matrix
distance measures have been investigated and compared through an
agglomerative clustering of RADARSAT-2 POLSAR data. The considered
matrix distance measures were used as similarity criteria for merging
clusters hierarchically into an appropriate number of classes. In this
study, the considered distances are Manhattan, Euclidean, Bartlett,
revised Wishart, Wishart test statistic, and Wishart Chernoff. Results
show that the Bartlett, revised Wishart, and Wishart Chernoff distances
all produce identical classification results. The Manhattan distance
retrieved classification results close to those obtained by the
Euclidean distance. The Bartlett, revised Wishart, and Wishart Chernoff
distances produced the most accurate classification results. The study
area is located in Hudson Bay offshore Churchill, Manitoba, Canada.}},

abstract={ Finding the edges between different regions in an image is one of the fundamental steps of image analysis, and several edge detectors suitable for the special statistics of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity images have previously been developed. In this paper, a new edge detector for polarimetric SAR images is presented using a newly developed test statistic in the complex Wishart distribution to test for equality of covariance matrices. The new edge detector can be applied to a wide range of SAR data from single-channel intensity data to multifrequency and/or multitemporal polarimetric SAR data. By simply changing the parameters characterizing the test statistic according to the applied SAR data, constant false-alarm rate detection is always obtained. An adaptive filtering scheme is presented, and the distributions of the detector are verified using simulated polarimetric SAR images. Using SAR data from the Danish airborne polarimetric SAR, EMISAR, it is demonstrated that superior edge detection results are obtained using polarimetric and/or multifrequency data compared to using only intensity data.},

  abstract = { Speckle filter performance depends strongly on the speckle and scene
	models used as the basis for filter development. These models implicitly
	incorporate certain assumptions about speckle, scene, and observed
	signals. In this study, the multiplicative and the product speckle
	models, which have been used for the development of most of the well-known
	filters, are analyzed, and their implicit assumptions with regard
	to the stationarity-nonstationarity nature of speckle are discussed.
	This leads to the definition of two categories of speckle filters:
	the stationary and the nonstationary multiplicative speckle model
	filters. The various approximate models used for the multiplicative
	speckle noise model are assessed as functions of speckle and scene
	characteristics to derive the requirements on scene signal variations
	for the validity of both the stationary and nonstationary multiplicative
	speckle models. Speckle filtering is then studied in the context
	of estimation theory, so as to develop a procedure for speckle filtering.
	It is shown that speckle filtering can be effective only in locally
	stationary scenes. Regions in which the signals are not stationary
	have to be filtered separately using a priori scene templates for
	the best matching of nonstationary scene features. The use of multiresolution
	techniques is crucial for accurate estimation of filter parameters.
	Under the guidance of the speckle filtering procedure, structural-multiresolution
	versions of the Lee (1980) and Frost et al. (1982) filters are developed

	of two-sigma probability, and it was reasonably effective in speckle
	filtering. However, deficiencies were discovered in producing biased
	estimation and in blurring and depressing strong reflected targets.
	The advancement of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology with
	high-resolution data of large dimensions demands better and efficient
	speckle filtering algorithms. In this paper, we extend and improve
	the Lee sigma filter by eliminating these deficiencies. The bias
	problem is solved by redefining the sigma range based on the speckle
	probability density functions. To mitigate the problems of blurring
	and depressing strong reflective scatterers, a target signature preservation
	technique is developed. In addition, we incorporate the minimum-mean-square-error
	estimator for adaptive speckle reduction. Simulated SAR data are
	used to quantitatively evaluate the characteristics of this improved
	sigma filter and to validate its effectiveness. The proposed algorithm
	is applied to spaceborne and airborne SAR data to demonstrate its
	overall speckle filtering characteristics as compared with other

	polarimetric properties and statistical correlation between channels,

	the last decade, speckle reduction of polarimetric SAR imagery has
	been studied using several different approaches. All of these approaches
	exploited the degree of statistical independence between linear polarization
	channels. The preservation of polarimetric properties and statistical
	characteristics such as correlation between channels were not carefully
	addressed. To avoid crosstalk, each element of the covariance matrix
	must be filtered independently. This rules out current methods of
	polarimetric SAR filtering. To preserve the polarimetric signature,
	each element of the covariance matrix should be filtered in a way
	similar to multilook processing by averaging the covariance matrix
	of neighboring pixels. However, this must be done without the deficiency
	of smearing the edges, which degrades image quality and corrupts
	polarimetric properties. The proposed polarimetric SAR filter uses
	edge-aligned nonsquare windows and applies the local statistics filter.
	The impact of using this polarimetric speckle filtering on terrain
	classification is quite dramatic in boosting classification performance.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce the homomorphic Gamma-WMAP (wavelet maximum
   a posteriori) filter, a wavelet-based statistical speckle filter
   equivalent to the well known Gamma-MAP filter. We perform a logarithmic
   transformation in order to make the speckle contribution additive and
   statistically independent of the radar cross section. Further, we
   propose to use the normal inverse Gaussian (NIG) distribution as a
   statistical model for the wavelet coefficients of both the reflectance
   image and the noise image. We show that the NIG distribution is an
   excellent statistical model for the wavelet coefficients of synthetic
   aperture radar images, and we present a method for estimating the
   parameters. We compare the homomorphic Gamma-WMAP filter with the
   Gamma-MAP filter and and the recently introduced Gamma-WMAP filter,
   which are both based on the same statistical assumptions. The
   homomorphic Gamma-WMAP filter is shown to have better performance with
   regard-to smoothing homogeneous regions. It may in some cases introduce
   a small bias, but in our studies it is always less than that introduced
   by the Gamma-MAP filter. Further, the speckle removed by the homomorphic
   Gamma-WMAP filter has statistics closer to the theoretical model than
   the speckle contribution removed with the other filters.}},

abstract={A class of fourth-order partial differential equations (PDEs) are proposed to optimize the trade-off between noise removal and edge preservation. The time evolution of these PDEs seeks to minimize a cost functional which is an increasing function of the absolute value of the Laplacian of the image intensity function. Since the Laplacian of an image at a pixel is zero if the image is planar in its neighborhood, these PDEs attempt to remove noise and preserve edges by approximating an observed image with a piecewise planar image. Piecewise planar images look more natural than step images which anisotropic diffusion (second order PDEs) uses to approximate an observed image. So the proposed PDEs are able to avoid the blocky effects widely seen in images processed by anisotropic diffusion, while achieving the degree of noise removal and edge preservation comparable to anisotropic diffusion. Although both approaches seem to be comparable in removing speckles in the observed images, speckles are more visible in images processed by the proposed PDEs, because piecewise planar images are less likely to mask speckles than step images and anisotropic diffusion tends to generate multiple false edges. Speckles can be easily removed by simple algorithms such as the one presented in this paper},

Ratioing of the multidate radar intensities is shown to be better adapted to the statistical characteristics of SAR data than subtracting, and works best when the number of looks is large. In a second set of techniques, changes are detected based on estimates of the temporal decorrelation of speckle. This method works best with one-look complex amplitude data, but can also be used with intensity data provided that the number of looks is small. The two techniques are compared using actual SAR data collected by ERS-1. The results illustrate the viability as well as the complementary character of these techniques for detecting changes in the structural and dielectric properties of remotely sensed surfaces},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce the homomorphic Gamma-WMAP (wavelet maximum
   a posteriori) filter, a wavelet-based statistical speckle filter
   equivalent to the well known Gamma-MAP filter. We perform a logarithmic
   transformation in order to make the speckle contribution additive and
   statistically independent of the radar cross section. Further, we
   propose to use the normal inverse Gaussian (NIG) distribution as a
   statistical model for the wavelet coefficients of both the reflectance
   image and the noise image. We show that the NIG distribution is an
   excellent statistical model for the wavelet coefficients of synthetic
   aperture radar images, and we present a method for estimating the
   parameters. We compare the homomorphic Gamma-WMAP filter with the
   Gamma-MAP filter and and the recently introduced Gamma-WMAP filter,
   which are both based on the same statistical assumptions. The
   homomorphic Gamma-WMAP filter is shown to have better performance with
   regard-to smoothing homogeneous regions. It may in some cases introduce
   a small bias, but in our studies it is always less than that introduced
   by the Gamma-MAP filter. Further, the speckle removed by the homomorphic
   Gamma-WMAP filter has statistics closer to the theoretical model than
   the speckle contribution removed with the other filters.}},

abstract={A class of fourth-order partial differential equations (PDEs) are proposed to optimize the trade-off between noise removal and edge preservation. The time evolution of these PDEs seeks to minimize a cost functional which is an increasing function of the absolute value of the Laplacian of the image intensity function. Since the Laplacian of an image at a pixel is zero if the image is planar in its neighborhood, these PDEs attempt to remove noise and preserve edges by approximating an observed image with a piecewise planar image. Piecewise planar images look more natural than step images which anisotropic diffusion (second order PDEs) uses to approximate an observed image. So the proposed PDEs are able to avoid the blocky effects widely seen in images processed by anisotropic diffusion, while achieving the degree of noise removal and edge preservation comparable to anisotropic diffusion. Although both approaches seem to be comparable in removing speckles in the observed images, speckles are more visible in images processed by the proposed PDEs, because piecewise planar images are less likely to mask speckles than step images and anisotropic diffusion tends to generate multiple false edges. Speckles can be easily removed by simple algorithms such as the one presented in this paper},

In this article, two unsupervised methods are introduced to estimate the speckle noise statistics using the mean and the standard deviation of small image blocks (4 × 4, or 6 × 6 pixels). Since most radar images contain many small homogeneous areas, a scatter plot of the standard deviation versus the mean can reveal the characteristic of the noise. The blocks from inhomogeneous areas have higher values for the standard deviation, and they are scattered above the main cluster. They are considered as outliers, and should be excluded in the statistical estimation. These two methods are designed for obtaining a linear fit in the scatter plot by ignoring outliers. Several synthetic aperture radar(SAR) images are used for illustration.},

abstract={This paper addresses estimation of the equivalent number of looks (ENL), an important parameter in statistical modeling of multilook synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Two new ENL estimators are discovered by looking at certain moments of the multilook polarimetric covariance matrix, which is commonly used to represent multilook polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data, and assuming that the covariance matrix is complex Wishart distributed. First, a second-order trace moment provides a polarimetric extension of the ENL definition and also a matrix-variate version of the conventional ENL estimator. The second estimator is obtained from the log-determinant matrix moment and is also shown to be the maximum likelihood estimator under the Wishart model. It proves to have much lower variance than any other known ENL estimator, whether applied to single-polarization or PolSAR data. Moreover, this estimator is less affected by texture and thus provides more accurate results than other estimators should the assumption of Gaussian statistics for the complex scattering coefficients be violated. These are the first known estimators to use the full covariance matrix as input, rather than individual intensity channels, and therefore to utilize all the statistical information available. We finally demonstrate how an ENL estimate can be computed automatically from the empirical density of small sample estimates calculated over a whole scene. We show that this method is more robust than procedures where the estimate is calculated in a manually selected region of interest.},

	Radar ( SAR) images is presented that preserves the structural features

	We show that the wavelet coefficients of SAR images have significantly
	non-Gaussian statistics that are best described by the 2-D GARCH
	model. By using the 2-D GARCH model on the wavelet coefficients,
	we are capable of taking into account important characteristics of
	wavelet coefficients, such as heavy tailed marginal distribution
	and the dependencies between the coefficients. Furthermore, we use
	a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator for estimating the clean image
	wavelet coefficients. Finally, we compare our proposed method with
	various speckle suppression methods applied on synthetic and actual
	SAR images and we verify the performance improvement in utilizing

  abstract = {In this paper, a new despeckling method based on undecimated wavelet
	decomposition and maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation is proposed.
	Such a method relies on the assumption that the probability density
	function (pdf) of each wavelet coefficient is generalized Gaussian
	(GG). The major novelty of the proposed approach is that the parameters
	of the GG pdf are taken to be space-varying within each wavelet frame.
	Thus, they may be adjusted to spatial image context, not only to
	scale and orientation. Since the MAP equation to be solved is a function
	of the parameters of the assumed pdf model, the variance and shape
	factor of the GG function are derived from the theoretical moments,
	which depend on the moments and joint moments of the observed noisy
	signal and on the statistics of speckle. The solution of the MAP
	equation yields the MAP estimate of the wavelet coefficients of the
	noise-free image. The restored SAR image is synthesized from such
	coefficients. Experimental results, carried out on both synthetic
	speckled images and true SAR images, demonstrate that MAP filtering
	can be successfully applied to SAR images represented in the shift-invariant
	wavelet domain, without resorting to a logarithmic transformation.

  abstract = { In this paper, a novel despeckling algorithm based on undecimated
	wavelet decomposition and maximum a posteriori estimation is proposed.
	Such a method represents an improvement with respect to the filter
	presented by the authors, and it is based on the same conjecture
	that the probability density functions (pdfs) of the wavelet coefficients
	follow a generalized Gaussian (GG) distribution. However, the approach
	introduced here presents two major novelties: 1) theoretically exact
	expressions for the estimation of the GG parameters are derived:
	such expressions do not require further assumptions other than the
	multiplicative model with uncorrelated speckle, and hold also in
	the case of a strongly correlated reflectivity; 2) a model for the
	classification of the wavelet coefficients according to their texture
	energy is introduced. This model allows us to classify the wavelet
	coefficients into classes having different degrees of heterogeneity,
	so that ad hoc estimation approaches can be devised for the different
	sets of coefficients. Three different implementations, characterized
	by different approaches for incorporating into the filtering procedure
	the information deriving from the segmentation of the wavelet coefficients,
	are proposed. Experimental results, carried out on both artificially
	speckled images and true synthetic aperture radar images, demonstrate
	that the proposed filtering approach outperforms the previous filters,
	irrespective of the features of the underlying reflectivity. },

  abstract = {The rice cropping system in Asia is undergoing major changes to cope
	with increasing demography and changing climate, making rice monitoring
	a critical issue. Past studies have demonstrated the use of C-band
	synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to map rice areas. The methods
	were based on the temporal change of intensity backscattering coefficient
	of vertically or horizontally co-polarized data (VV or HH). In this
	paper, we assess the use of the HH/VV polarization ratio derived
	from Advanced SAR (ASAR) data from ENVIS AT data for the production
	of rice paddy maps. The approach is based on past knowledge on the
	polarization behavior of rice canopy, i.e., VV backscattering is
	much lower than HH during a large part of the rice season, due to
	the attenuation of the wave by the vertical structure of the plants.
	The methodology is developed for the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, where
	a complex cropping pattern is found (one to three crops of rice per
	year). The approach includes a statistical analysis of the HH/VV
	distributions of rice and non-rice classes at different dates. The
	analysis results confirm that HH/VV can be used as classifier and
	point out the need for relevant speckle filtering prior to classification.
	A classification method is developed and applied to single- and multidate
	data sets. The methods are tested at one district of the province
	of An Giang and extended to the whole province. Comparisons of the
	mapping results to geographic-information-system land-use data and
	official agricultural statistics show very good agreement. The method
	will be further applied to the entire Mekong Delta. © 2008 IEEE.},

  abstract = {In this paper a new method of speckle reduction of SAR images in curvelet
	domain is proposed. In the method, curvelet transform is integrated
	with wavelet filtering. The new method consists of five parts: preprocessing,
	curvelet transform (CT), curvelet coefficients processing and two
	inverse transforms. In the preprocessing step, homomorphic transform
	is applied to convert multiplicative- noise- in- SAR- images- to-
	an- additive-noise which is suitable to be dealt with curvelets.
	After curvelet transform, curvelet coefficients are thresholded by
	using soft and hard thresholding functions with improved rules. In
	hard thresholding rule, noise variations are obtained by using noise
	parameter estimation. In soft thresholding rule, a classic soft thresholding
	function and thresholding rule used in wavelet domain is combined
	with curvelets. Finally, inverse CT and exponential transform are
	employed to reconstruct denoising image. Comparisons of speckle removing
	results by using different thresholding methods are also given in
	this paper. It can be seen that the method presented in the paper
	is an effective one. © 2008 IEEE.},

	an autobinomial model (ABM), which models a prior probability density
	function (pdf); meanwhile, the likelihood pdf is modeled as a gamma
	distribution. Analytically, a solution for a maximum a posteriori
	estimate using an autobinomial prior cannot be computed; therefore,
	an approximation is introduced using differential. The best ABM for
	approximating the texture parameters in SAR images is found by using
	second-order Bayesian inference. The edges in the SAR images are
	detected using region borders, which have statistically different
	properties. Coefficient of variation is used to distinguish between
	homogeneous and heterogeneous areas. The experimental results show
	that the proposed method preserves the textural features and removes
	noise significantly in the homogeneous and heterogeneous regions.
	The proposed despeckling method is good regarding objective measures
	for synthetic images and better despeckles the real SAR images, when
	compared with the state-of-the-art MBD methods.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider the restoration of images with signal-dependent
	noise. The filter is noise smoothing and adapts to local changes
	in image statistics based on a nonstationary mean, nonstationary
	variance (NMNV) image model. For images degraded by a class of uncorrelated,
	signal-dependent noise without blur, the adaptive noise smoothing
	filter becomes a point processor and is similar to Lee's local statistics
	algorithm [16]. The filter is able to adapt itself to the nonstationary
	local image statistics in the presence of different types of signal-dependent
	noise. For multiplicative noise, the adaptive noise smoothing filter
	is a systematic derivation of Lee's algorithm with some extensions
	that allow different estimators for the local image variance. The
	advantage of the derivation is its easy extension to deal with various
	types of signal-dependent noise. Film-grain and Poisson signal-dependent
	restoration problems are also considered as examples. All the nonstationary
	image statistical parameters needed for the filter can be estimated
	from the noisy image and no a priori information about the original
	image is required.},

  abstract = {This study comes within the framework of the global cartography and
	inventory of the Polynesian landscape. An AIRSAR airborne acquired
	fully Polarimetrie data in L band, in August 2000, over the main
	Polynesian Islands. This study focuses on Tubuai Island, where several
	ground surveys allow the validation of the different results. While
	they preserve some of the Polarimetrie information as those that
	would be recorded by a full polarimetric (FP) radar sensor, compact
	polarimetry architectures are relevant for systems constraints reduction.
	Focus is put on the "π/4" mode that is simulated from FP data. It
	has been shown that this mode is particularly efficient for applications
	dealing with distributed targets like land use classification. In
	this study, the SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm is used as
	classification method due to its ability to handle linearly non separable
	cases by using the kernel method. In particular, it is well suited
	for combining numerous heterogeneous indicators such as intensity
	channels, polarimetric descriptors, or textural parameters. The results
	show that for full polarimetric data, the SVM classification performance
	when only the elements of the polarimetric coherence matrix are involved
	is comparable to the Wishart classification one. The addition of
	polarimetric indices improves significantly the classification. On
	the other hand when "π/4" mode is simulated, the overall classification
	performance is similar (κ lower of 3%) than those observed with full
	polarimetric data, with a higher confusion for the Pinus class. Moreover,
	the "π/4" mode shows much better performance for the land use discrimination
	of the studied scene than ENVISAT Alternate Polarisation modes involving
	intensities acquired in co or cross polarization. Topic:Compact_Polarimetric},

	radar (SAR) speckle filtering. The new approach emphasizes preserving
	polarimetric properties and statistical correlation between channels,

	the last decade, speckle reduction of polarimetric SAR imagery has
	been studied using several different approaches. All of these approaches
	exploited the degree of statistical independence between linear polarization
	channels. The preservation of polarimetric properties and statistical
	characteristics such as correlation between channels were not carefully
	addressed. To avoid crosstalk, each element of the covariance matrix
	must be filtered independently. This rules out current methods of
	polarimetric SAR filtering. To preserve the polarimetric signature,
	each element of the covariance matrix should be filtered in a way
	similar to multilook processing by averaging the covariance matrix
	of neighboring pixels. However, this must be done without the deficiency
	of smearing the edges, which degrades image quality and corrupts
	polarimetric properties. The proposed polarimetric SAR filter uses
	edge-aligned nonsquare windows and applies the local statistics filter.
	The impact of using this polarimetric speckle filtering on terrain
	classification is quite dramatic in boosting classification performance.

  abstract = {The presence of speckle in radar images makes the radiometric and
	textural aspects less efficient for class discrimination. Many adaptive
	filters have been developed for speckle reduction, the most well
	known of which are analyzed. It is shown that they are based on a
	test related to the local coefficient of variation of the observed
	image, which describes the scene heterogeneity. Some practical criteria
	are introduced to modify the filters in order to make them more efficient.
	The filters are tested on a simulated synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
	image and an SAR-580 image. As was expected, the new filters perform
	better, i.e. they average the homogeneous areas better and preserve
	texture information, edges, linear features, and point target responses
	better at the same time. Moreover, they can be adapted to features
	other than the coefficient of variation to reduce the speckle while
	preserving the corresponding information},

  abstract = { Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are affected by speckle noise,
	originated by the SAR system's coherent nature. The problem of speckle
	noise in one-dimensional (1-D) data is already solved, as speckle
	has a multiplicative characteristic. SAR polarimetry represents an
	extension to multidimensional data by the use of polarization wave
	diversity. As a consequence of the existence of a correlation degree
	between the SAR images, the 1-D speckle noise model cannot be extended
	to multidimensional SAR data. This paper is devoted to present a
	completely new speckle noise model for the complex covariance matrix
	describing polarimetric SAR data in the distributed scatterers case.
	As is shown, this new model is able to identify which are the noise
	mechanisms in all the covariance matrix elements. The speckle noise
	model is validated by using real L-band polarimetric data acquired
	with the German E-SAR sensor.},

  abstract = {Speckle is a major cause of degradation in synthetic aperture radar
	(SAR) imagery. With the availability of fully polarimetric SAR data,
	it is possible to use the three complex elements (HH, HV, VV) of
	the polarimetric scattering matrix to reduce speckle. The optimal
	method for combining the elements of the scattering matrix to minimize
	image speckle is derived, and the solution is shown to be a polarimetric
	whitening filter (PWF). A simulation of spatially correlated, K-distributed,
	fully polarimetric clutter is then used to compare the PWF with other,
	suboptimal speckle-reduction methods. Target detection performance
	of the PWF, span, and single-channel |HH|<sup>2</sup> detectors is
	compared with that of the optimal polarimetric detector (OPD). A
	novel, constant-false-alarm-rate (CFAR) detector (the adaptive PWF)
	is as a simple alternative to the OPD for detecting targets in clutter.
	This algorithm estimates the polarization covariance of the clutter,
	uses the covariance to construct the minimum-speckle image, and then
	tests for the presence of a target. An exact theoretical analysis
	of the adaptive PWF is presented; the algorithm is shown to have
	detection performance comparable with that of the OPD.},

	polarimetric sea surface scattering with and without surface slicks,
	entirely based on the Mueller scattering matrix, is proposed. Dealing
	with slick-free or weak-damping-slick-covered sea surface a Bragg
	scattering mechanism is expected, while, a non-Bragg scattering mechanism
	is expected in case of oil-covered sea surface. Following this rationale,
	the Mueller scattering matrix is physically read in terms of slick-free
	and slick-covered sea surface scattering mechanisms, through the
	analysis of some Mueller based polarimetric descriptors, i.e. the
	degree of polarization, the statistics of the phase difference and
	the pedestal height. Experiments accomplished on Level 1.1 full polarimetric
	L-band ALOS PalSAR data confirm the effectiveness of the proposed
	approach. ©2009 IEEE.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a comparative evaluation of several speckle reduction
	and texture analysis techniques, with particular emphasis on their
	applicability to supervised land cover classification from SAR images.
	Issues related to suppression of speckle in a uniform area, preservation
	of edges, and texture preservation are pursued in these filters.
	Quality of texture features is measured by the relevancy, discriminative
	power and ease of computation of the features. The discriminative
	power of texture features is measured using the Jeffreys-Matusita
	distance and classification performance measured on a validation
	set independent from the classifier's training set. Classifiers investigated
	are maximum-likelihood, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis
	function (RBF) neural networks. Classification accuracy is measured
	by KHAT statistic calculated from confusion matrices. Two SAR images
	of ERS-1 and E-SAR programme showing different land cover categories
	within the regions of Douala and Ngaoundéré (Cameroon), and a bi-polarized
	Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image from an agricultural station
	near the city of Altona (Canada) are used for analysis. Speckle suppression
	techniques based on the wavelet transform performs the best, followed
	by the modified K-nearest neighbours and the Lee's local statistic
	filters. Depending on the nature of the land cover types being classified,
	texture features derived from second- and third-order histogram performed
	the best, followed by first-order statistics and features derived
	using the grey-level difference vector method. Among all classifiers
	considered, the MLP and the RBF neural networks performed the best,
	achieving up to 94% overall accuracy for the E-SAR image of Douala,
	for example.},

  abstract = {A space-variant interpolation is required to compensate for the migration
	of signal energy through range resolution cells when processing synthetic
	aperture radar (SAR) data, using either the classical range/Doppler
	(R/D) algorithm or related frequency domain techniques. In general,
	interpolation requires significant computation time, and leads to
	loss of image quality, especially in the complex image. The new chirp
	scaling algorithm avoids interpolation, yet performs range cell migration
	correction accurately. The algorithm requires only complex multiplies
	and Fourier transforms to implement, is inherently phase preserving,
	and is suitable for wide-swath, large-beamwidth, and large-squint
	applications. This paper describes the chirp scaling algorithm, summarizes
	simulation results, presents imagery processed with the algorithm,
	and reviews quantitative measures of its performance. Based on quantitative
	comparison, the chirp scaling algorithm provides image quality equal
	to or better than the precision range/Doppler processor. Over the
	range of parameters tested, image quality results approach the theoretical
	limit, as defined by the system bandwidth},

  abstract = {A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) often is constrained to transmit
	only one polarization. Within this constraint, two aggressive measurement
	objectives are 1) full characterization and exploitation of the backscattered
	field, and 2) invariance to geometrical orientations of features
	in the scene. Full characterization implies coherent dual-polarization
	to support the four Stokes parameters. These are rotationally invariant
	with respect backscatterer orientation if and only if the transmission
	is circularly polarized. Given that the data products are the Stokes
	parameters, the receivers can use any orthogonal polarization basis.
	A SAR in hybrid-polarity architecture (CL-pol) transmits circular
	polarization and receives two orthogonal mutually coherent linear
	polarizations, which is one manifestation of compact polarimetry.
	The resulting radar is relatively simple to implement, and has unique
	self-calibration features and low susceptibility to noise and cross-channel
	errors. It is the architecture of choice for two lunar radars scheduled
	for launch in 2008. Data from a CL-pol SAR yield to decomposition
	strategies such as the m-δ method introduced in this paper. © 2007

	radar (SAR) is designed to measure terrain surface deformation and
	forest biomass, hence its quadrature-polarimetric SAR mode. The objective
	to provide quantitative information on a global scale imposes severe
	requirements on the radar to maximize coverage and to sustain reliable
	operational calibration. These requirements are best served by the
	hybrid-polarity architecture, in which the radar transmits in circular
	polarization, and receives on two orthogonal linear polarizations,
	coherently, retaining their relative phase. This architecture offers
	many significant advantages over conventional all-linearly-polarized
	SARs. This paper reviews those advantages, summarizes key attributes
	of hybrid-polarity dual- and quadrature-polarized SARs including
	conditions under which the signal-to-noise ratio is conserved, and
	describes the evolution of this architecture from first principles.},

  abstract = {We present results of polarimetric observations of comet 17P/Holmes
	that in 2007 surprised the observers by its outburst that resulted
	in dramatically increased brightness and unusual shape of the coma.
	Polarimetric properties of the comet also appeared to be very peculiar.
	Even though the comet showed negative polarization typical for the
	small phase angles, its absolute values were much lower than usually
	observed at these phase angles and the spectral gradient of the polarization
	was much more pronounced than usually observed for comets (although
	negative that is typical for other comets too). Both these results
	are different from the regular trends and indicate some specifics
	of the comet Holmes dust during the outburst. We discuss how such
	unusual polarimetric properties of the comet can be explained and
	show how a peculiar combination of aggregated and compact particles
	or a composition with a unique ratio of silicates to organics can
	explain the observational results. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

	in a space environment for surface parameter estimation is investigated.
	CP consists of transmitting a single polarization while receiving
	two polarizations. At longer wavelengths, one of the main challenges
	associated with CP from space is Faraday rotation (FR) estimation
	and correction. In this paper, an estimation procedure for FR is
	presented, which relies on the scattering properties of bare surfaces.
	The selection of the bare surfaces is based on a new parameter, the
	conformity coefficient computed from CP measurements. This parameter
	is shown to be FR invariant. Once estimated, the FR can be corrected
	over the whole image. A simple approximation to and based on CP measurements
	over bare soil surfaces is presented, from which soil moisture can
	be estimated using the 1995 Dubois algorithm. The results obtained
	using CP are shown to be in good agreement with those obtained from
	the standard Dubois algorithm using fully polarimetric data. This
	implies that, for soil moisture, CP can be used instead of HH and

	It is shown that polarimetric data can be speckle reduced if and
	only if all the elements of the Mueller matrix are filtered, which
	is equivalent to filtering the scattering vector covariance matrix.
	Assuming that speckle is multiplicative and stationary, the algorithms
	proposed in [1] and [2] are extended to filter the covariance matrix
	of reciprocal and nonreciprocal targets on one-look and multilook
	images. The problem of estimation of the first- and second-order
	statistics of the four-channel speckle vector is discussed, and a
	solution is proposed for one-look and multilook images.},

  abstract = { Speckle filter performance depends strongly on the speckle and scene
	models used as the basis for filter development. These models implicitly
	incorporate certain assumptions about speckle, scene, and observed
	signals. In this study, the multiplicative and the product speckle
	models, which have been used for the development of most of the well-known
	filters, are analyzed, and their implicit assumptions with regard
	to the stationarity-nonstationarity nature of speckle are discussed.
	This leads to the definition of two categories of speckle filters:
	the stationary and the nonstationary multiplicative speckle model
	filters. The various approximate models used for the multiplicative
	speckle noise model are assessed as functions of speckle and scene
	characteristics to derive the requirements on scene signal variations
	for the validity of both the stationary and nonstationary multiplicative
	speckle models. Speckle filtering is then studied in the context
	of estimation theory, so as to develop a procedure for speckle filtering.
	It is shown that speckle filtering can be effective only in locally
	stationary scenes. Regions in which the signals are not stationary
	have to be filtered separately using a priori scene templates for
	the best matching of nonstationary scene features. The use of multiresolution
	techniques is crucial for accurate estimation of filter parameters.
	Under the guidance of the speckle filtering procedure, structural-multiresolution
	versions of the Lee (1980) and Frost et al. (1982) filters are developed
	for optimum application of these filters in the context of nonstationary
	scene signals.},

  abstract = {Wetlands continue to be under threat, and there is a major need for
	mapping and monitoring wetlands for better management and protection
	of these sensitive areas. Only a few studies have been published
	on wetland characterization using polarimetric synthetic aperture
	radars (SARs). The most successful results have been obtained using
	the phase difference between HH and VV polarizations, φHH φ, which
	has shown promise for separating flooded wetland classes. Recently,
	we have introduced a new decomposition, the Touzi decomposition,
	which describes target scattering type in terms of a complex entity,
	the symmetric scattering type. Huynen's target helicity is used to
	assess the symmetric nature of target scattering. In this paper,
	the new complex-scattering-type parameters, the magnitude α<sub>s</sub>
	and phase Φ <sub>αs</sub>, are investigated for wetland characterization.
	The use of the dominant-scattering-type phase Φ<sub>αs</sub> makes
	it possible to discriminate shrub bogs from poor (sedge or shrub)
	fens. These two classes cannot be separated using φ HH - φ VV, or
	the radiometric scattering information provided by α<sub>s</sub>,
	the Cloude α, the entropy H, and the multipolarization HHHVVV channels.
	φ<sub>αs</sub>, which cannot detect deep (45 cm below the peat surface)
	water flow in a bog, is more sensitive to the shallower (1020-cm)
	fen beneath water, and this makes possible the separation of poor
	fens from shrub bogs. Φ<sub>αs</sub> also permits the discrimination
	of conifer-dominated treed bog from upland deciduous forest under
	leafy conditions. Target helicity information is exploited to introduce
	a new parameter, the target asymmetry. The latter is shown very promising
	for detection of forest changes between leafy and no-leaf conditions.
	The analysis of low-entropy marsh scattering showed that both the
	scattering-type magnitude and phase α<sub>s</sub> and Φ <sub>αs</sub>,
	respectively, as well as the maximum polarization intensity of the
	dominant scattering m, are needed for a better understanding of marsh
	complex scattering mechanisms. The unique information provided by
	the new roll-invariant decomposition parameters are demonstrated
	using repeat-pass Convair-580 polarimetric C-band SAR data collected
	in June and October 1995 over the RAMSAR Mer Bleue wetland site near
	Ottawa (Canada). © 2006 IEEE.},

	neighborhood (AN) is determined by a region growing technique driven
	exclusively by the intensity image information. All the available
	intensity images of the polarimetric and interferometric terms are
	fused in the region growing process to ensure the validity of the
	stationarity assumption. Afterward, all the pixels within the obtained
	AN are used to yield the filtered values of the polarimetric and
	interferometric coherency matrices, which can be derived either by
	direct complex multilooking or from the locally linear minimum mean-squared
	error (LLMMSE) estimator. The entropy/alpha/anisotropy decomposition
	is then applied to the estimated polarimetric coherency matrices,
	and coherence optimization is performed on the estimated polarimetric
	and interferometric coherency matrices. Using this decomposition,
	unsupervised classification for land applications by an iterative
	algorithm based on a complex Wishart density function is also applied.
	The method has been tested on airborne high-resolution polarimetric
	interferometric synthetic aperture radar (POL-InSAR) images (Oberpfaffenhofen
	area-German Space Agency). For comparison purposes, the two estimation
	techniques (complex multilooking and LLMMSE) were tested using three
	different spatial supports: a fix-sized symmetric neighborhood (boxcar
	filter), directional nonsymmetric windows, and the proposed AN. Subjective
	and objective performance analysis, including coherence edge detection,
	receiver operating characteristics plots, and bias reduction tables,
	recommends the proposed algorithm as an effective POL-InSAR postprocessing

	be applied on adaptive neighborhoods. Interesting results are obtained
	when coupling this FP estimator with an adaptive spatial support

  abstract = {Speckle noise is always present in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
	images. Many methods that reduce speckle noise while preserving texture
	and detail have been presented previously. In this paper, a comparison
	of different methods using wavelet decomposition is performed and
	new improvements for traditional methods are introduced. These techniques
	are: Wiener filtering, classical soft threshold, a new adaptive soft
	threshold and Bayesian reconstruction. First, speckle noise in a
	SAR image was analysed statistically. Then, a simulated image following
	these characteristics was created in order to evaluate noise reduction.
	The mean squared error was classified depending on the spatial characteristics
	of a local region. This tool gave valuable information for algorithm
	assessment. In the comparison, the new adaptive soft threshold method
	provided excellent results concerning noise reduction and detail
	preservation compared with classical soft threshold and Wiener methods.
	In addition, it gave as much noise reduction as the most sophisticated
	Bayesian method, but much more efficiently. Hence, the adaptive version
	of soft thresholding outperformed the other techniques. This study
	also presents a rigorous framework for speckle noise simulation and
	noise reduction evaluation. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.},

	The advantage with the SAR sensor is the all weather and day/night
	imaging capability. However, the SAR backscatter contrast between
	a vessel and the surrounding sea state may be small in high wind
	conditions and at small incidence angles. The present and future
	SAR satellites will have the capability of imaging the earth surface
	with several incidence angles, and with dual-polarimetry (HH/HV,
	VV/VH or HH/VV). The SAR ship/clutter contrast may threrefore be
	increased by applying different polarisation combinations, or using
	higher incidence angles. We have shown that geocoded ENVISAT ASAR
	images in the coastal region of Norway can be used to gain experience
	in the combined use of satellite SAR and an automatic identification
	system (AIS) for ship traffic monitoring. There are plans for placing
	AIS systems onboard satellites. It will then be possible to fuse
	the information from satellite SAR with those from satellite (or
	ground-based coastal) AIS and thereby identify all the detected ships
	within a SAR image. This data fusion will enable us to develop further
	knowledge about SAR backscatter properties from vessel types that
	may not be detected so well using the SAR data only. On the other
	side, it will be possible to pin-point those ship candidates that
	do not carry an AIS system, and thereby take appropriate security

	Satellite (ALOS) is capable of globally acquiring fully polarimetric
	data. In order to confirm the ability of L-band polarimetric synthetic
	aperture radar (SAR) to investigate sea ice before the ALOS launch,
	we conducted a field experiment using an airborne Polarimetric and
	Interferometric SAR (Pi-SAR) in the Sea of Okhotsk in 1999. This
	paper presents the analyzed results of data acquired in that experiment.
	The extracted polarimetric parameters of several ice types suggested
	that polarimetric coherences and phase differences between right-right
	(RR) and left-left (LL) are good candidates for discriminating ice
	types. The polarimetric anisotropy as well as the beta angle of the
	first eigenvector calculated in the polarimetric decomposition procedure
	are alternative parameters that are sensitive to ice type differences.
	Due to the low depolarization characteristics of open water, it could
	be discriminated from sea ice by scattering entropy in all incidence
	angle ranges. From the relation between ice thickness and the polarimetric
	parameters, we found that backscattering coefficients and vertical
	(VV) to horizontal (HH) backscattering ratio are highly correlated
	with ice thickness. Since the ratio is sensitive to ice surface dielectric
	constants, a simple simulation using the integral equation method
	surface model was conducted by using the physical parameters of typical
	sea ice. A two-dimensional ice thickness map was derived from an
	empirical relation between the VV-to-HH backscattering ratio and

  abstract = {Aiming at the problem that common curvelet may bring fuzzy edge when
	denoising, this paper proposes a novel edge-enhanced speckle suppression
	method using curvelet transform with an optimal soft thresholding.
	The method combines the original images' edge detection with the
	filtered image of each subband. In the edge area, first the edge
	information from the remnant image is extracted, and then the edge
	information is added to the filtered image. In the non-edge area,
	to increase the contrast with the edge and have a clean background,
	a mean filter is used to smooth the area. As a result, the edge enhanced
	image is gained. In order to reduce the affection of disadvantages
	from both hard thresholding and soft thresholding filtering to the
	curvelet coefficients, the method also adopts an optimal soft shresholding
	for filtering. The simulation results show that the de- noising method
	can significantly reduce the speckles while enhancing the edge and
	the structure of the original SAR images with more smoothness in
	backguound areas.},

abstract = {In this paper we first review an algorithm which performs radar cross- section estimation by using techniques based on simulated annealing. Standard simulated annealing approaches to image restoration attempt to categorize each image element as belonging to one of a small number of predefined image states or values. This is restrictive for tasks such as radar cross-section estimation and we present here an algorithm which is capable of producing a real-valued output. This is achieved by introducing an edge detection stage into the simulated annealing process. This original cross-section estimation is based on a flat region model. This is extended here to include linear sloping regions. Results using this new model are given and a qualitative comparison drawn with the original flat region model approach.},

In this paper, we evaluate the performance of the images produced by this technique in terms of preserving and enhancing these features. The findings of our analysis indicate that the new SAR image formation method provides images with higher resolution of scatterers, and better separability of different regions as compared to conventional SAR images.},

abstract = {Goal of this paper is the development and evaluation of a fully automatic method for quality assessment of despeckled synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The rationale of the new approach is that any structural perturbation introduced by despeckling, e.g. a local bias of mean or the blur of a sharp edge or the suppression of a point target, may be regarded either as the introduction of a new structure or as the suppression of an existing one. Conversely, plain removal of random noise does not change structures in the image. Structures are identified as clusters in the scatterplot of original to filtered image. Ideal filtering should produce clusters all aligned along the main diagonal. In practice clusters are moved far from the diagonal. Clusters' centers are detected through the mean shift algorithm. A structural change feature is defined at each pixel from the position and population of off-diagonal cluster, according to Shannon's information theoretic concepts. Results on true SAR images (COSMO-SkyMed) will be presented. Bayesian estimators (LMMSE: liner minimum mean squared error: MAP: maximum a-posteriori probability) operating in the undecimated wavelet domain have been coupled with segment-based processing. Quality measurements of despeckled SAR images carried out by means of the proposed method highlight the benefits of segmented MAP filtering.},

abstract={Speckle is a granular disturbance, usually modeled as a multiplicative noise, that affects synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, as well as all coherent images. Over the last three decades, several methods have been proposed for the reduction of speckle, or despeckling, in SAR images. Goal of this paper is making a comprehensive review of despeckling methods since their birth, over thirty years ago, highlighting trends and changing approaches over years. The concept of fully developed speckle is explained. Drawbacks of homomorphic filtering are pointed out. Assets of multiresolution despeckling, as opposite to spatial-domain despeckling, are highlighted. Also advantages of undecimated, or stationary, wavelet transforms over decimated ones are discussed. Bayesian estimators and probability density function (pdf) models in both spatial and multiresolution domains are reviewed. Scale-space varying pdf models, as opposite to scale varying models, are promoted. Promising methods following non-Bayesian approaches, like nonlocal (NL) filtering and total variation (TV) regularization, are reviewed and compared to spatial- and wavelet-domain Bayesian filters. Both established and new trends for assessment of despeckling are presented. A few experiments on simulated data and real COSMO-SkyMed SAR images highlight, on one side the costperformance tradeoff of the different methods, on the other side the effectiveness of solutions purposely designed for SAR heterogeneity and not fully developed speckle. Eventually, upcoming methods based on new concepts of signal processing, like compressive sensing, are foreseen as a new generation of despeckling, after spatial-domain and multiresolution-domain methods.},

Under the assumption that human visual perception is highly adapted for extracting structural information from a scene, we introduce an alternative complementary framework for quality assessment based on the degradation of structural information. As a specific example of this concept, we develop a structural similarity index and demonstrate its promise through a set of intuitive examples, as well as comparison to both subjective ratings and state-of-the-art objective methods on a database of images compressed with JPEG and JPEG2000.
